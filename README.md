# triangle

#### This program will determine if three inputs are a triangle and if so what type of triangle.

### By Kendra Ash and Terry Marr

##
  This program creates a class Triangle and two methods: is_valid? and type.
  The triangle accepts 3 inputs which represent the sides of a triangle.  First it checks whether the inputs add up to be a valid triangle using pythagoran theorem, then it returns what type of triangle it is, equilateral, isosceles, or scalene.
